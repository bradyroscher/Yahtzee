## Description
___
#### Robahtzee is a JavaScript Yahtzee game I've made for a school project. Making use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I've created a fully functional game with replayability. Even after completion there's a few features to be added. Some I've already done, like the two-player mode, and some that will be an interesting challenge to come back too, like the CPU-mode.
